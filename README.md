This data package contains size and geometry data of 1242 *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* cells grown across 25 conditions.
The included cell size measures are length, width, surface area, and volume.
It also provides details about the culture conditions that the cells were grown in, and summary statistics of the single-cell data set grouped by culture condition.

For details on how the data was generated and a full analysis, see the associated publication (Bertaux *et al.*, 2023).
The code generating the figure panels for the publication is provided in [/vignettes/articles/micropublication-figures.Rmd](/vignettes/articles/micropublication-figures.Rmd).
